## Music Recommendation System

This system uses facial expression recognition technology as the core means of emotion recognition, combined with machine learning algorithms for emotion classification, to obtain the user's emotional information in real time. Then, based on the emotion label and the user's music preference model, a personalized music recommendation list is generated using various recommendation algorithms such as collaborative filtering and content recommendation. Through the construction of the emotion-music relationship model, the system is not only able to recommend music for the user that matches his current emotional state, but also predicts the type of music that the user may like, improving the user experience.
